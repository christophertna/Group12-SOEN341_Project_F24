Here are the new features/enhancements of the peer assessment app introduced during Sprint 3:

- Graphical visualisation
Instructors can now see student data sorted in two different types of graphical formats. One of which is the
Spider Graph, where the instructor can compare a student's strong and weak points, and even compare them to
other students within that same student's group. Another format that is available is the Bar Graph, where each
of the student's evaluation critera are also shown compared to eachother.

- Grade contesting
When the grades are made available for students to see upon their login, students will have the ability to
contest their given grade if they feel like the grade given to them by their peers did not reflect their
true contribution to the work. A red button directly below their average score display will be available for
them to press, which will allow them to also write a quick message to their respective instructor, inwhich
upon sending, will alert the instructor via a notification.
